## React Hooks
A function available to use that "hooks" in React features(example:useState, useEffect, useRef, useContext)


### React Hook Rules

1. The hook name itself, must use the word "use"

2. Has to be inside of the component. Must be envoked only in React functions

3. Only call hooks at the top level of your functions

We cannot use react hooks, in helper functions. They must be readily available to use in React components
