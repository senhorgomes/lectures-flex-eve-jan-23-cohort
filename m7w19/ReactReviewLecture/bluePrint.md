Two things that we are building today
- Frontend React with fake data
-- Created the fake data
-- Create the React app
-- Create our first component(ul component, that maps through each individual hero and return an li)

- Node express backend
-- It will act as a mock database, where the client can connect and fetch information
- Connect the two server=>frontend

Fake data=Artists? Movies? Cats? Superheroes? Something else?
Marvel SuperHeroes
